## Overview

Hexo inherits EventEmitter of Node.js. You can subscribe or publish specified events. For example:

``` js
hexo.on('ready', function(){
  console.log('Hexo is ready to go!');
});
```

## Methods

All methods except `emit` returns the emitter itself, so calls can be chained.

### addListener(event, listener)
### on(event, listener)

### once(event, listener)

Listens to the specified event **only once**. After the event is fired, the listener will be removed.

### removeListener(event, listener)

Removes a listener from the specified event.

### removeAllListeners([event])

### emit(event, [arg1], [arg2], [â€¦])
